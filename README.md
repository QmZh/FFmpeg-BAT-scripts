# FFmpeg BAT scripts
FFmpeg BAT scripts to do some simple video/audio edits

# How to use
Download [ffmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/), extract it to a folder, add that bin subfolder to path, which contains ffmpeg.exe. For example, [direct link(release essentials)](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.7z) (this should be the smallest build on that site).

Download the bat scripts, put them to a folder, add that folder to path.

Use explorer to navigate to the folder containing your video/audio files, open a terminal there (Press Shift and right click, select open PowerShell here) and use the scripts by type the name of the script file and arguments into the terminal. Check that you might need to type extra arguments when ffmpeg is running, for example "y" to agree to replace existing file with the same name.
